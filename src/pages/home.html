                huge clientele. Whether a company is a startup or an established

                Managing tax and accounting is not an easy task, as decisions
                often impact cash flow and reporting implications. This is
                especially true for companies going global. Even basic-level
                bookkeeping must be adapted to fit the reporting standards of
                the applicable country.

                Complicated reporting requirements in foreign jurisdictions
                greatly increase the cost of in-house resources, and can
                becoming a burden, taking business owners away from their core
                business.
